- [Review Classification - using Random Forest + word2vec](https://github.com/jpnevrones/Amazon-fine-food-review/blob/master/Classification%20Algorithm/RandomForest-Classifier-using-wordEmbeddingFrom-word2vector-gensim.ipynb)  
  - Trained a word2vec model using Gensim package with the following parameter value ( Word vector dimensionality  = 300, Minimum word count =40, Number of threads to run in parallel  = 3,  Context window size = 10 and downsampling rate for frequent words = 1e-3).
  - Created Feature vector to be used by random forest model by averaging word embeddings of all words in the review.
  - Accuracy : 0.895
